Load modules:
```bash
module load LUMI/24.03
module load systools    # provides Singularity/Apptainer
```



Build a writable development container

```bash
singularity build --sandbox webbrowsing.sif webbrowsing.def

singularity exec web_browsing.sif /bin/bash

lynx https://csc.fi/en/
```


Here the tools like lynx can show web pages as formatted text, but they cannot render images inside a pure terminal. At best, theyâ€™ll show [IMAGE] markers or ALT text.

If you are using a terminal emulator that supports inline graphics (e.g. Kitty, iTerm2 with imgcat, or wezterm), then some text-based browsers (w3m-img) can display inline images â€” but that requires extra support both in the browser and the terminal. On LUMIâ€™s HPC environment, you normally just get a standard text-only terminal over SSH, so inline images arenâ€™t possible.

For full graphical browsing (Firefox, Chromium, etc.), youâ€™d need to run them under X11 forwarding, Wayland remote desktop, or through something like VNC/NoMachine â€” which is heavier and usually not what you want on login/compute nodes.

ðŸ‘‰ For your current use case (secure sandboxed browsing with Lynx), expect only text-based interaction, no images.
